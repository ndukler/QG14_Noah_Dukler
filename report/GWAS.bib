	abstract = {Variance-components and regression-based methods are frequently used to map quantitative trait loci. The normality of the trait values is usually assumed and violation of this assumption can have a detrimental effect on the power and type I error of such analyses. Various transformations can be used, but appropriate transformations usually require careful analysis of individual traits, which is not feasible for data sets with a large number of traits like those in Problem 1 of Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 ({GAW}15). A semiparametric variance-components method can estimate the transformation along with the model parameters, but existing methods are computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose the use of empirical normal quantile transformation to normalize the scaled rank of trait values using an inverse normal transformation. Despite its simplicity and potential loss of information, this transformation is shown, by extensive simulations, to have good control of power and type I error, even when compared with the semiparametric method. To investigate the impact of such a transformation on real data sets, we apply variance-components and variance-regression methods to the expression data of {GAW}15 and compare the results before and after transformation.},

	abstract = {{TSPO} mediated transport of cholesterol into the mitochondrion is a necessary step in steroid synthesis. The rs6971 polymorphism in the {TSPO} gene causes an amino acid substitution (Ala147Thr) within the transmembrane domain where the cholesterol-binding pocket is located, and has been shown to affect the steroidogenic pathway. We report a nominal association between this {TSPO} polymorphism and the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder in both the genome-wide dataset of the Wellcome Trust Case–Control Consortium and the Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study Consortium Bipolar Disorder group ({OR} = 1.11, p = 0.007; {OR} = 1.10, p = 0.011, respectively). We propose that the amino acid substitution affects hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal ({HPA}) regulation, and hence may predispose to Bipolar Disorder. This supports the hypothesis that {HPA} dysregulation has a causal role in Bipolar Disorder, and is not just a consequence of the disease.},

	abstract = {Retinol dehydrogenase 13 ({RDH}13) is a recently identified short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase related to microsomal retinoid oxidoreductase {RDH}11. In this study, we examined the distribution of {RDH}13 in human tissues, determined its subcellular localization and characterized the substrate and cofactor specificity of purified {RDH}13 in order to better understand its properties. The results of this study demonstrate that {RDH}13 exhibits a wide tissue distribution and, by contrast with other members of the {RDH}11-like group of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, is a mitochondrial rather than a microsomal protein. Protease protection assays suggest that {RDH}13 is localized on the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Kinetic analysis of the purified protein shows that {RDH}13 is catalytically active and recognizes retinoids as substrates. Similar to the microsomal {RDHs}, {RDH}11, {RDH}12 and {RDH}14, {RDH}13 exhibits a much lower Km value for {NADPH} than for {NADH} and has a greater catalytic efficiency in the reductive than in the oxidative direction. The localization of {RDH}13 at the entrance to the mitochondrial matrix suggests that it may function to protect mitochondria against oxidative stress associated with the highly reactive retinaldehyde produced from dietary β-carotene.},

	abstract = {Complete knowledge of all direct and indirect interactions between proteins in a given cell would represent an important milestone towards a comprehensive description of cellular mechanisms and functions. Although this goal is still elusive, considerable progress has been made-particularly for certain model organisms and functional systems. Currently, protein interactions and associations are annotated at various levels of detail in online resources, ranging from raw data repositories to highly formalized pathway databases. For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The {STRING} database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {\textgreater}1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of {STRING}, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks.},
