\noindent Noah Dukler

Data for this project were derived from 79 chinese and 107 Yoruban individuals for a total study size of 186 people. The gender breakdown was 92 females and 94 males however only SNP data for chromosome 22 was included for this study so sex specific effects are highly unlikely. SNP data was filtered to remove alleles with MAF<0.05 resulting in the removal of 562 variants. All individuals were completely genotyped so none were removed. Re-clustering all study individuals based on genotype cleanly recapitulated the ethnic labeling in the HapMap files along the 1st PC with no obvious outliers so no individuals appear to be mislabeled. Individuals were not separated by sex along any of the other PCs as expected.
